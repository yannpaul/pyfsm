Introduction
============

pyfsm, a named used already, is a simple, example python package where I'm
experimenting with:

1. using doctest for 'behavior driven development'
2. what it takes to make Finite State Machines in python
3. using dectorators to quickly build applications.

Other Finite State Machine libraries in python
==============================================

There are many others, including one named 
`pyfsm <http:https://github.com/bbotella/pyfsm>`_. You can find a list of other 
examples on python.org's 
`wiki <https://wiki.python.org/moin/FiniteStateMachine>`_, though some of
those links are broken. 

TODO
====

1. Make an installer script (setup.py)
2. Add examples that do not rely on global state
3. Add code to convert a table description into a FSM
4. Complete code coverage
5. Add the ability to have on enter and on exit actions per state. 
6. Examples...

Quick Start
===========

.. note:: 
   The example used in the quick start is inspired by chapter 10 of Robert 
   Cecil Martin's *UML for Java Programmers*.
